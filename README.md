This project is just a step-by-step implementation of instructions from the spring's article: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/

To run it:
- use "mvn install" or "mvn package" to build spring boot executable .jar archive
- run created .jar file (ex: demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) using "java -jar filename.jar" command (you should see the spring's logo when starting application)
- go to "localhost:8080" in your browser
